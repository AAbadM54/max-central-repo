# Contribution Guide

This is an open source project, and we appreciate your help!

Generally, we expect two maintainers to review your pull request before it is approved for merging. Please follow the guidelines specified in below before submitting the pull request.

## Open Source Licenses

All of the models in the Model Asset Exchange are released under the [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or a similar open-source license. If releasing a pretrained model then the data must also be an open-source license such as the [Community Data License Agreement (CDLA)](https://cdla.io/sharing-1-0/) or [Creative Commons Share-Alike (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licenses.


## Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the pull request to indicate acceptance prior to merging. A change requires LGTMs from two project maintainers. If the code is written by a maintainer, the change only requires one additional LGTM.

## Does the proposed model or code change have positive impact?

Some proposed changes may not represent a positive impact to the project. Ask whether or not the change will make understanding the code easier, or if it could simply be a personal preference on the part of the author.

Pull request that do not have a clear positive impact should be closed without merging.

For any given pull request related to model addition, ask yourself "is this model a new addition to the domain?" and "is this state-of-the-art model for the proposed application?"

If so, does the pull request (or associated issue) contain narrative indicating the need for the model? If not, provide that information.

Before merging code, remember to check for the following:

- Are new unit tests in place that test all new features introduced?
- Does the code pass through flake8 ?
- Is documentation in place for the new feature or model?
